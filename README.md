Instructions:

Run pip install -r requirements.txt before you run the web application!

Go into gpt3_request.py, and save your own OpenAI API key as openai.api_key.

Run server.py (from the webapp folder).

The webapp works best in fullscreen mode. Note that when you submit the forms, the web app will buffer for 2-4 seconds. This is normal!
