The ants are marching one by one

There are seven layers to the OSI model
And each one has a different function

The first layer is the physical layer
Which is responsible for the electrical signals

The second layer is the data link layer
Which is responsible for the data packets

The third layer is the network layer
Which is responsible for the data routing

The fourth layer is the transport layer
Which is responsible for the data flow control

The fifth layer is the session layer
Which is responsible for the data session management

The sixth layer is the presentation layer
Which is responsible for the data presentation

The seventh layer is the application layer
Which is responsible for the data application"

There are seven layers to the OSI model
Just like there are seven colors in a rainbow

Layer one is the physical layer
Layer two is the data link layer
Layer three is the network layer
Layer four is the transport layer
Layer five is the session layer
Layer six is the presentation layer
Layer seven is the application layer

Each layer has a specific function
And each one is important to the whole

Just like each star in the sky
Each one shining bright

The OSI model is just like a rainbow
Each layer is important to the whole

Just like each star in the sky
Each one shining bright"

Are you awake?

Yes, we are awake
